# Yes-No-Constant-Gabor-Stimuli-Detection-Threshold
script to find psychometric threshold of detection using the method of constant stimuli under a yes/no paradigm. 

Mostly Finished. Missing data saving, but probably won't implement since we probably won't ever run this code on someone.

 - Plots psychometric function and records RT to each type of gabor
